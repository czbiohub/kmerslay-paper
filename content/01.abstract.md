## Abstract

RNA-sequencing is a widely used measure of cellular state, and it is often used as proxy for estimating abundance of protein-coding molecules.
However, the tools to estimate protein-coding sequence from RNA-seq reads don't allow for extraction of protein-coding sequences from distantly related species.
We present `kmerslay`, a suite of $k$-mer based tools to extract protein-coding sequences from RNA-seq reads using reduced amino acid alphabets to allow for flexibility in proteome evolution.
`kmerslay` can also perform all-by-all $k$-mer similarity of sequences in both amino acid and nucleotide reduced alphabets to find clusters of similar sequences which can then be used for homology inference.
By enabling extraction of protein-coding sequences across a wide variety of species, `kmerslay` spearheads analysis of non-model organisms and their contribution to the evolution of life.
